In this level we get a binary file with a suid bit set and by running that binary it says
that we had to connect it to a port and if it gets the corect password of the bandit20 then it 
will send the password for the next level

so we ssh into another terminal and run nc listner on port 4444
then we run the binary ./suconnect 4444
and on the nc reverse shell we send the password of bandit20 and in return we the password for the next level

the password for bandit21 is gE269g2h3mw3pwgrj0Ha9Uoqen1c9DGr
