In this level we ssh into a wierd place saying that "WELCOME TO THE UPPERCASE SHELL"

everything just type changes to UPPERCASE

so in order to get around this we just enter "$0"
and now we get a regular shell 
so we just run whoami and we can see that we are bandit33

so we just cat the password of bandit33 from /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33

the password of bandit33 is c9c3199ddf4121b10cf581a98d51caee
