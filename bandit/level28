In this level again we have to clone a repository like in the previous challenge we did

after cloning the repository we see a README.md file and in that file the password was not written

so we do a git log command and that show us the changes log

one of the log contains a message as "add missing data"

for seeing that changes we can do git show <git sha1 identifier>

this will give us the password which was changes in the latter commits

the password for bandit29 is bbc96594b4e001778eee9975372716b2
