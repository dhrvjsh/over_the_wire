In this level again we have to clone a repository like in the previous challenges we did

after cloning the directory we can see that the password is not present in the current file

In this level we had to push a file to the repository

so we create a file named key.txt with the content "May I come in?

and we will push this file with the command

git add . and then git commit and we see a message that there is nothing to commit

so we see that there is a .gitignore file and it contains a *.txt so we use -f 

git add -f key.txt and then git commit and add a commit message

and then git push and now we get our password for the next level

the password for bandit32 is 56a9bf19c63d650ce78e6ec0354ee45e
