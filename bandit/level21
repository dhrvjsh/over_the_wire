In this level we need to investigate cron job running

after seeing cron job named cronjob_bandit22 at /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit22
we can see a job /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null

after seeing the file at /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh 
it is a script which is cating the password in file in tmp directory

after seeing that file we get the password for bandit22 
the password for bandit22 is Yk7owGAcWjwMVRwrTesJEwB7WVOiILLI
