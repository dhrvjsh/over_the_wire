In this we just try to get shell on the system
we just repeat the steps in the previous level and get into vi texteditor

after getting into vi 
we enter the command
:set shell=/bin/bash
:shell

and we will get a shell with user bandit26

now we can see that there is binary named bandit27-do with suid bit set
we can get password for bandit27 with this binary
bandit2-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27
the password for bandit27 user is 3ba3118a22e93127a4ed485be72ef5ea
