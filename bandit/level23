In this challenge we need to investigate the cron job and also write a script in order to get the passwd

first we see the cron job which points to the script in /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24

this is written in the script

#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)

cd /var/spool/$myname
echo "Executing and deleting all scripts in /var/spool/$myname:"
for i in * .*;
do
    if [ "$i" != "." -a "$i" != ".." ];
    then
        echo "Handling $i"
        owner="$(stat --format "%U" ./$i)"
        if [ "${owner}" = "bandit23" ]; then
            timeout -s 9 60 ./$i
        fi
        rm -f ./$i
    fi
done


we can see that what this script to is execute all the script present in /var/spool/bandit24
and delete them after 60 sec
bandit24 directory has write permission for us

so we create a directory in tmp directory where will will store our script

by entering command "mkdir -p /tmp/ba" to create directory named ba in tmp

now we create a script named script.sh in that ba directory

what are script do is simply copy the password of bandit24 to a passwd file present in /tmp/ba directory

#!/bin/bash

cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/ba/passwd

give all permission to this script.sh file

with the command "chmod 777 script.sh"

and also create a file passwd and also give proper permission to this file
with the command "chmod 666 passwd"

now copy our script to /var/spool/bandit24 directory with cp command

now just wait for a minute and we will get password for bandit24 in the passwd file

the passwd for bandit24 is UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ
