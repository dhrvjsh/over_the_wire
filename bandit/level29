In this level again we have to clone a repository like in the previous challenges we did

after cloning the directory we can see that the password is not present in the current file

so we see that there are other branches for this
so for knowing what branches are there
we enter command git branche -after
this we show all the branche of this project

not going to a branch name "remotes/origin/dev" by entering command git checkout remotes/origin/dev

this we get us in that branch
now we will enter a command git log for seeing the commits and see the last commit by entering the command
git show <commit sha1 identifier>

this will give us the password for the next level

the password for bandit30 is 5b90576bedb2cc04c86a9e924ce42faf
