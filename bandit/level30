In this level again we have to clone a repository like in the previous challenges we did

after cloning the directory we can see that the password is not present in the current file

we tried all the steps we use in the previous challenges but no luck so far

there is .git directory in the cloned repository and entering that we can see the git internals

there is a file named "packed-refs"

seeing that file we can see there is another branch named refs/tags/secret and there is also a hash for this

so we do git show <hash> and we see a another hash and that is the password for the next level

the password for bandit31 is 47e603bb428404d265f59c42920d81e5
