In this level after we ssh to bandit 25 we get a ssh private key of bandit26 
and we know from the site that bandit26 user dosn't have a /bin/bash login
so after login via private we get exitied of the ssh

so we see the passwd file in order to view what is happening while ssh into bandit26

after viewing passwd file we can see that it is pointing to /usr/bin/showtext

after seeing that file
#!/bin/sh

export TERM=linux

more ~/text.txt
exit 0

we can see that it is opening text.txt file with more command
we know that we can run commands with more command

so we make our ssh terminal window small so that more command will buffer the content of the file
and after ssh into bandit26 we just enter "v" keyword and this will open vi text editor inside more command
now what we can do is open another file in vi editor with entering ":" and then r /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26

and this will give us the password for user bandit26
the password for bandit26 is 5czgV9L3Xx8JPOyRbXh6lQbmIOWvPT6Z
