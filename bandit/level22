In this level we need to investigate the cron job that is running 

after seeing cron job named cronjob_bandit23 at /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit23
we can see a job /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh &> /dev/null

after seeing the file at /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh
this is written in that script

#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)
mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"

cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/$mytarget

what this script does is storing the current user in variable named myname
and encypt that username into md5 and copying that password of bandit23 in file 
which is the md5 encypt name of the current user

what we can do to extract the name of the user in md5 is

we can run this command in our own terminal

myname=bandit23
mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)
echo $mytarget

this will give us the file name 8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349

now we can run command on the target machine

cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349

and this willl give us the password for bandit23 which is jc1udXuA1tiHqjIsL8yaapX5XIAI6i0n
